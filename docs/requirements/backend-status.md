## Critical Issues to Address ðŸš¨

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Need to properly separate dev and prod configurations
   - Database migration strategy needed
   - Storage strategy needs to be environment-aware

2. **Security**
   - Current security implementation is basic and needs enhancement
   - No proper authentication system in place
   - Missing role-based access control
   - Need to enhance guest session management

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Need to implement proper storage strategy
     - Local storage for development
     - S3 storage for production
   - Missing document versioning
   - No proper cleanup mechanism
   - Need to implement storage quotas

4. **Bank Integration**
   - Axis bank parser is incomplete
   - Limited bank support
   - Need to validate bank selection

5. **User Management**
   - Basic User model needs completion
   - Missing user authentication
   - No user preferences
   - Need guest to registered user conversion

6. **Testing**
   - Lack of comprehensive testing
